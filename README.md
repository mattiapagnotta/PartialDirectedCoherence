# PartialDirectedCoherence
Code to derive the different variants of Partial Directed Coherence (PDC). A detailed description
of these functional connectivity measures can be found in:

  Baccal√°, L. A., & Sameshima, K. (2014). Partial directed coherence. Methods in brain
  connectivity inference through multivariate time series analysis, 57-73.

The function relies on routines and codes from the Source Information Flow Toolbox (SIFT):
